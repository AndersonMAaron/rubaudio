# Rubaudio

Uses audio parsing tools to query video/audio catalogs for audio patterns.

## Background

As a video editor, you may start to notice certain patterns in your audio and
their correlation to certain events in your footage. A 10 minute video file
may contain only 10 seconds of usable video. Generally, a spike in audio
means something exciting has happened. Rubaudio will detect these spikes
and output relational information.
